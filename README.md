This repository contains the resources and scripts used in a research study exploring the effectiveness of ChatGPT (specifically the GPT-4o-mini model) in detecting software vulnerabilities. The study examines the relationship between ChatGPT's accuracy and factors such as lines of code (LOC) and cyclomatic complexity in source code.
