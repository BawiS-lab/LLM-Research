This repository contains the resources and scripts used in a research study exploring the effectiveness of ChatGPT (specifically the GPT-4o-mini model) in detecting software vulnerabilities. The study examines the relationship between ChatGPT's accuracy and factors such as lines of code (LOC) and cyclomatic complexity in source code.

file.ipynb - Python scripts used to automate and analyze the vulnerability detection process. These scripts include the logic for testing ChatGPTâ€™s performance on the dataset.

all_c_cpp_release2.0.csv.zip - The dataset of vulnerable files used for testing, including information about recorded vulnerabilities for comparison.
